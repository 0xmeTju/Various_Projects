# Projects

This folder contains code from different areas and time periods of my coding journey that I find worth mentioning.

## Network

This folder has two projects from my network-related code.

### P2P Communicator

A project focused on creating a custom network protocol that supports peer-to-peer communication. It includes client and server modes, and these two can send files between each other. The project also supports keep-alive packets.

### Packet Analyzer

A project focused on processing internet traffic in `.pcap` format and transforming it into `.yaml` format, which contains statistics and other data. This project is essentially a WireShark clone.

## Artificial Intelligence

This folder contains a few small projects that were used to become familiar with AI topics and theory.

### Cluster Generator

A project that groups points into clusters using various clustering techniques.

### Rush Hour

An AI designed to beat the simple children's game "Rush Hour." It will find the best solution for the game's ever-changing settings.

### Treasure Hunter

An AI created to find the optimal way to collect all treasures on a grid map. This AI uses a genetic algorithm with elitism and various other tactics.
